v1.4.7:
 - made the goodness-of-fit in orbit_fitter an actual chi-squared
 - fixed type mismatch in coords.pole_rotation_inv
 - added timestep.get_bound_mass()
 - added timestep.check_for_incest()
 - edited github readme
 - split_at_id_wrap works again for new Nbody formatting, added a toggle for user-inputted 
   values for backwards compatability

v1.4.6: (BUG FIX)
 - the reverse orbit in orbit_fitter.get_OrbitData_from_orbit() was using the forwards
   orbit to calculate vgsr. Fixed
 - timestep.only_dark_matter() had a typo that made it identical to only_baryons(). Fixed
 - did some refactoring of orbit_fitter to make it easier to read and more consistent with
   things like changing the timestep and potential

v1.4.5: (MINOR PATCH)
 - fixed bug where orbit fitter plots would use the mwahpy default potential even
   if another was provided
 - output_handler.read_output() now works for files with the <bodies> </bodies> tags format
 - changed name of sky_to_pole() to pole_rotation(), because it was confusing. 
   sky_to_pole() is now an alias for pole_rotation() and causes a DeprecationWarning
 - added pole_rotation_inv() function
 - timestep.scatter() now has a 'cbar' keyword to turn on a colorbar & shade particles appropriately
 - improved how .coords was checking types
 - added eq_to_OC() transformation from ra/dec to Orphan-Chenab lambda/beta, 
   and OC_to_eq() inverse transformation

v1.4.4: (MINOR PATCH)
 - orbit_fitter gradient descent now uses Nelder-Mead optimizer by default, BFGS
   was terminating the optimization early
 - fixed bug in calc_self_energies where KE was 2x as large as it should be
 - added ability to change galaxy potential in orbit_fitter.py

v1.4.3: (BUG FIX)
 - fixed some typos that would prevent the package from initializing correctly
 - fixed plot.hist()
 - fixed print_particle()
 - calc_rvpm() was adding an additional unnecessary (unsupported) key to the
   timestep object
 - made timestep.recenter() and timestep.update() more verbose
 - warnings are now printed, not raised as errors
 - typos in plot.fancy_plot()
 - fixed incorrect sizing of plot.fancy_plot()

v1.4.2: (MINOR PATCH)
 - Now using python's built-in Warning class instead of manually checking flags
   and printing warning statements
 - orbit_fitter and orbit_fitter_gc now have two modes: 'de' (differential evolution)
   and 'gd' (gradient descent). Mode 'de' requires bounds, and mode 'gd' requires
   an initial guess. These are selected with the 'mode' keyword in
   orbit_fitter.fit_orbit() and orbit_fitter_gc.fit_orbit().
 - the phase space coordinates of the Sun are now a PhaseSpace class, which can be
   updated throughout the package with mwahpy_glob.solar_ps.update(<[x, y, z, vx, vy, vz]>).
   To access the x velocity of the phase space coordinate, for example, you now use
   mwahpy_glob.solar_ps.vx.

v1.4.1:
 MAJOR CHANGES:
 - now require python v3.6.0 or above due to installation problems with older
   versions of python.
 - fixed bug in orbit_fitter and orbit_fitter_gc where using numpy arrays for
   velocity data would not properly set flags, but lists would crash the program
 - progress bars do not show up in jupyter notebooks now, to prevent lagging out
   the client
 - global flags are now instances of the Flag class (located in flags.py), which
   can be switched on or off globally with "myflag.switch(<bool>)". They can still
   be treated with default boolean comparisons, e.g. "if myflag:".
 MINOR CHANGES:
 - phase space of the Sun is now a constant in mwahpy_glob and should be accessed
   from there instead of hard-coded
 - added fancy_plot() in .plot, can call as timestep.fancy_plot(<...>)
 - changed coords.rv_to_vgsr() to coords.vlos_to_vgsr() (trying to avoid overloading
   "radial velocity")
 - added coords.vgsr_to_vlos()
 - didn't need to be importing or utilizing sys
 BUG FIXES:
 - fixed divide-by-zero error in timestep.get_self_energies()
 - fixed bug in coords.rot_around_arb_axis() that was slowing it down slightly
 - fixed bug in output_handler.read_output() where the progress bar would not
   go from 0 to 100% if the 'stop' keyword was used
 - coords.remove_sol_mot_from_pm() no longer modifies the pmra and pmdec input
   arrays in place

v1.4.0:
 - renamed orbit_fitting and orbit_fitting_gc to orbit_fitter and orbit_fitter_gc
 - refactored and fixed orbit_fitter
 - added documentation for orbit_fitter and orbit_fitter_gc
 - added documentation for changes since v1.3.5
 - functions that were re-used between orbit_fitter and orbit_fitter_gc are now
   all located in orbit_fitter
 - it's not really a chi-squared, so now it's just a goodness-of-fit in the orbit
   fitting packages

v1.3.8:
 - refactored and fixed orbit_fitting_gc
 - better way to do coords.cart_to_plane()
 - added coords.cart_to_lonlat()
 - coords.gal_to_lambet() and coords.cart_to_lambet() now use coords.cart_to_lonlat()
   in the background as abstraction
 - added coords.gal_to_lambet_galcentric(), will probably be deprecated soon in
   order to clarify coordinate systems

v1.3.7:
 - Fixed sign of Ly
 - added start and stop keywords to output_handler.read_output()

v1.3.6:
 - fixed sky_to_pole() tests and a couple other tests
 - fixed a bug with output_handler.make_nbody_input() not writing '\n' at end of file

v1.3.5:
 - sky_to_pole() now uses a change of basis matrix instead of vector math
 - fixed bugs with mismatches of Timestep.index_list after extra calculations
 - Timestep.id is now an array of ints, not floats
 - added Timestep.take_by_id()
 - output_handler.make_nbody_input() now properly handles the 'recenter' keyword argument
 - output_handler.make_nbody_input() pads now floats correctly
 - updated README
 - Timestep.typ is now a list of ints, not floats

v1.3.4:
 - Timestep.typ attribute stores whether particles are baryons (0) or dark matter (1)
 - output_handler has been updated to also read in particle type
 - Timestep.only_baryons() and Timestep_only_dark_matter() cut the data to only
   include one type of particle
 - Added support for galactic spherical coordinates (phi, theta)
 - Added find_progenitor()
 - make_nbody_input() no longer recenters the Timestep before printing out
 - fixed 'self not defined' error in output_handler.make_csv()
 - Timestep.rad and Timestep.rot are now Timestep.vrad and Timestep.vrot
 - updated documentation pdf to new naming convention
 - updated documentation to include all supported functions
 - updated README
 - removed coords.approx_lsr()

v1.3.3:
 - added changelog
 - fixed bug in Timestep.copy() that would cause error if the Timestep had calculated values
 - adapted python standard naming convention (mostly, method names went from camelCase to lower_case)
 - consolidated coords.py tests into tests.py
 - bug fix in coords.cart_to_plane()
 - fixed import scheme
